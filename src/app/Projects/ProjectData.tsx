        All 3D assets in this project is created by me except The bone and VR Controller model. The bone model used in this project is the pelvic bone model obtained from Z-Anatomy. This highly detailed model provides an accurate representation of human anatomy, which is essential for effective learning. The applicationâ€™s content features modified transformations of the bone model, allowing students to explore and observe the pelvic bone from all angles. This interactive experience enhances their understanding of the structure and function of the bone, making learning more engaging and immersive. Additionally, the application includes quizzes designed to assess students&apos; ability to recognize and identify different parts of the pelvic bone. These quizzes not only reinforce their knowledge but also provide immediate feedback, helping students track their progress and understanding of skeletal anatomy. Through this innovative approach, the application aims to improve the educational experience for students at Mataram University.

        In its development, I used the XRI Package provided by Unity. This package was utilized solely to obtain input from the Oculus Quest 2, and I did not use the Grab Interactable component that it offers. The limitations of this component hindered the realization of the design requested by the university. As a result, I recreated the functionalities for grabbing, rotating, and scaling to align with the university&apos;s desired design.

          One of my Unity-based game inspired by Panjat Pinang, a traditional Indonesian activity celebrated during Indonesia&apos;s Independence Day. in the game participants climb a slippery pole and claim prizes. I developed this project to not only commemorate the national holiday but also to showcase the potential of integrating cultural heritage with interactive digital experiences.

          The game was built using the Unity game engine. The gameplay interface features a menu where players can set up the event. Users can input rewards, define the height of the pole (Tinggi Tiang), and manage participants (Peserta) through a UI. Players are listed dynamically, and the system ensures that all information is processed smoothly. The animated characters climbing the pole reflect the fun and teamwork typical of the real-life event.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify">
          To manage the backend, I developed a REST API using Spring Boot, which connects the game to a relational database. The database stores player login info, participants names and the rewards they earned during the game.
